# Heart Disease Prediction using Machine Learning

## Project Overview
This project uses machine learning techniques to predict the presence of heart disease in patients based on various medical attributes. The implementation focuses on using a K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classifier to make predictions, with thorough data exploration and preprocessing steps.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains various patient medical attributes that are potential indicators of heart disease. Key features include:
- Age
- Sex
- Chest pain type (cp)
- Resting blood pressure (trestbps)
- Cholesterol levels (chol)
- And several other clinical measurements

## Implementation Steps
1. **Data Exploration**: Initial analysis of dataset structure and statistics
2. **Data Visualization**: Correlation matrix and feature distributions
3. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - One-hot encoding for categorical variables
   - Standard scaling for numerical features
4. **Model Training**: KNN classifier with varying neighbor values
5. **Performance Evaluation**: Accuracy scoring for different K values

## Results
The KNN classifier achieved its best performance with 8 neighbors, reaching an accuracy score of [insert score]% on the test set. The visualization shows how accuracy changes with different K values.
